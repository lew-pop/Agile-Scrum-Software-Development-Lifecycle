# Sprint-Review-and-Retrospective

# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Communication is probably the most significant element of the Agile framework. Interactions between the end-user, client, and product owner play vital roles in interpreting user needs and requirements for a program. Developing defined user stories for the product backlog may be the second most essential component for a successful Agile development team. User stories play many roles in the Agile methodology. User stories help develop the Product Backlog, acceptance criteria, and test cases. The product backlog created from user stories breaks up epics into small iterations defined by Scrum events. User stories also act as a platform for communication between end-users and the development team in a simplified common language. 

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

I have learned a lot from the Agile methodology. I can apply the whole Agile process when developing programs. I can break up the criteria for a program to create a product backlog. I can Create mini sprints to target items in the Product Backlog and implement all the Agile SDLC phases planning, analysis, designing, building, and testing. Another element I learned from Agile is not to be afraid to fail, and small regulated failures are learning curves. I also realized the importance of communication between end-users, Product Owners, Scrum Masters, Developers, and Stakeholders. Communication plays a vital role in the success of a development project, and I hope to improve my communication skills throughout my journey.  

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Characteristics of a good team member are transparent, proactive, accountable, available, and cross-functional. A good team member prioritizes events and tasks and understands the elements of project development that are essential for the team's progress. Good team members work closely together to develop goals and support each other's progress. Being mindful and transparent about impediments are vital characteristics of a good team member.
